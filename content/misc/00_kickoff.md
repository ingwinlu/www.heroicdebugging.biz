This post mostly serves as a Placeholder so I can see how pelican handels things in a live environment.

Upcoming Content will mostly feature how I set up my Rasperry Pi as a small home server, serving my media streaming and linux development environment needs. Maybe also how I setup pelican and the rest of the blogging mumbo-jumbo.

I'll try to keep up with at least a post a week.[^1]

Have a nice weekend!
