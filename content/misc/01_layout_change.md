Over the last few days I tried hard to costumize the default theme of pelican and succeeded somewhat. But in the end the inflexibility and the numerous overwrites in the css templates made it a giant timesink. 

Thankfully pelican is flexible enough to simply change the layout. So i looked over the available ones and decided to go with [pelican-bootstrap3][pelican-bootstrap3-link] from [http://dandydev.net/](http://dandydev.net/) with the [cosmo theme][cosmo-theme-link].

Nothing is perfect though and I had to change the way the [cosmo theme][cosmo-theme-link] handles tables and I was no big fan of the overwritten link style in the style.css.

Additionally there were some problems with the references towards the iconset which came with [pelican-bootstrap3][pelican-bootstrap3-link].

But for now I am happy and I think moving was the right choice to save time in the future.
