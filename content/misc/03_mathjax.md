Short test to see if how my [mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/) template works with pelican. 

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$


#####Update
There was already a [plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/render_math) for that which acts a bit more sophisticated then my quick hack. Switching to that one now.
