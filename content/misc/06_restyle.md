Summary: Restyle, Pagers and an update on simpleMediaCenter

Back from my short vacation. You might have noticed I went a bit nuts and restyled the great pelican-bootstrap3 theme to put content into panels. As a reminder here is a picture of the [old](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7pkq5zniyobekqv/heroic_old.PNG "Old") style. 

I also added an option to use a pager instead of pagination simply because it looks simpler which goes nice with the new look. A pull request to the pelican-bootstrap3 repository is already [up](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3/pull/100).

The simpleMediaCenter is coming along nicely, currently working on auto selection of players for more enduser comfort. After that I am probably going to halt development for a while after adding some much needed documentation and installation instructions.
