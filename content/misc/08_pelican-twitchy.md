Hey everyone, I did another thing! Introducing my new pelican theme: [pelican-twitchy]!

It is based on bootstrap3 with a static navbar on the left and a lot of space on the right. Technically is based heavily on [pelican-bootstrap3] and borrows some code from it as well, while the design is somewhat inspred from [Twitch].

There is still some work to do, mainly writing documentation, expanding features, finding bugs, but I really like it right know, thats why this blog will not be served with it. The old [pelican-bootstrap3] version can still be found at the [bs3 subdomain](http://bs3.heroicdebugging.biz).
