Title: About

My name is Winlu, currently living in Vienna, Austria.
I studied Computer Science at TU Vienna and am working for Catalysts AT.
I like Computers, Food, Motorbikes and Coffee!

Thank you for checking out my Blog!

### Why heroicdebugging.biz?
**Heroic Debugging** is similar to [Heroic Programming](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HeroicProgramming).
It describes the struggles of uncoordinated coding/testing/debugging without a
structured procedure (for example
[test-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development))
to help.
I first came across this term when talking about
**'diminishing returns of Heroic Debugging'** in a development process,
which start high but get worse over time and complexity.
The sentence stuck with me.

Answering why **.biz** is easier, because it was dirt cheap.


### What content will be on this blog?
I do like programming (everything from c to erlang) so this will be most of the
content on here, but I plan to also put up some content about my other hobbies:
motorbikes, computer games and music!
