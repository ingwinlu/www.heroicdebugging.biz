Title: About


My name is Winlu, currently living in Vienna, Austria. Studying Computer Science at TU Vienna and working for the SESAR Project. I like Computers, Food, Motorbikes and Coffee!

Thank you for checking out my Blog!

###Why heroicdebugging.biz?

**Heroic Debugging** is similar to [Heroic Programming](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HeroicProgramming). It describes the struggles of uncoordinated coding/testing/debugging without a structured procedure (for example [test-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)) to help. I first came across this term when talking about **'diminishing returns of Heroic Debugging'** in a development process, which start high but get worse over time and complexity. The sentence stuck with me.

Answering why **.biz** is easier, because it was dirt cheap.


###What content will be on this blog?

I do like **programming** (everything from c to erlang) so this will be most of the content on here, but I plan to also put up some content about my other hobbies, like **motorbikes**, **computer games** and **music**!

###Current Projects:
*   **Kuhbox**, a dropbox python console client with a focus on backup features
*   [Simple Media Center](https://github.com/ingwinlu/simpleMediaCenter), media center application, written in python, alternative to xbmc
*   [heroicpastie](http://pastie.heroicdebugging.biz), a pastie site developed in erlang/cb
*   [pelican-twitchy](https://github.com/ingwinlu/pelican-twitchy), the pelican theme you are looking at right now :)
