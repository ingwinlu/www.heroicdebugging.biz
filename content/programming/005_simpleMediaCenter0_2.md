Summary: Second working release of Simple Media Center (simpleMC)

Been busy, added a simple fileCrawler (which still is buggy). But it works okayish already! Next up is some css styling for the index page and hopefully I find why fileCrawler sometimes acts strange.

Check out the [source code here](https://github.com/ingwinlu/simpleMediaCenter) and if you want to contribute to the project don't hesitate to contact me!
