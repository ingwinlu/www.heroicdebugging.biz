Summary: added Youtube search function to my XBMC alternative

Hey!

Quite some time has passed since I have done one of these for my XBMC alternative. Lots of improvements on the user side this time.

* Players now get selected auto-magically based on the currently selected browser
* restructured how browsers handle menu navigation (though I am not happy with that yet, may need another redesign **sigh**)
* configparser is now in and provides a basic option to customize the user experience, a web front end to change settings is on the TODO list (for much later)
* and added browser functionality for searching
