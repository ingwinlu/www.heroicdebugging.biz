Since my RPi did not survive a reboot yesterday I quckly moved the site over to github for hosting. This move is temporary and I will return to host via my trusty RPi as soon as I can get to it. 

This also affects all hosted webservices i.e. [heroicpastie](http://pastie.heroicdebugging.biz) and some other development sites which will return to service once I can troubleshoot what went wrong with the hardware.

###Update 2014-08-21
Full Service restored. Rejoice.
